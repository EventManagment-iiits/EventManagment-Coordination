# EventManagment-Coordination

# Problem statement

Event Management & Coordination involves planning, organizing, executing, and evaluating events such as academic seminars, workshops, cultural programs, and institutional activities. Currently, event-related activities like registrations, attendee handling, venue booking, staff coordination, and post-event analysis are managed manually or using multiple disconnected tools. This leads to scheduling conflicts, lack of coordination, data inconsistency, and difficulty in tracking event performance.

This project aims to design a centralized Event Management & Coordination Platform that supports event registration, resource and staff allocation, smooth event execution, and post-event analytics, thereby improving efficiency, transparency, and coordination.
